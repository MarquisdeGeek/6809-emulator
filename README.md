# 6809-emulator
The emulator code for a 6809e, written in 68000 assembler

## Platform
This should build using DevPac on the Amiga. It might work elsewhere.

It was originally tied to an AMOS-written front end.

## This release
This has been released since it was my first proper emulator and, in the rare case that it is useful to someone, I wouldn't want it languishing on a hard drive.

At some point this, and most emulators, will become irrelevant as my EMF project (http://em.ulat.es) provides a way to generate any emulator for any platform. Until then, I am releasing whatever files I can find from my original emulation projects for Dragon, ZX81, Jupiter Ace, and ZX Spectrum.
